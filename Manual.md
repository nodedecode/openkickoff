This page details the original user manual of Kick Off 2.

# Kick Off 2 Full Instruction Manual #

## 1.0 INTRODUCTION ##

Kick Off 2 retains the pace and accuracy of the universally acclaimed Kick Off. A soccer simulation with a full size multi directional scrolling pitch and the players, markings, goals etc in correct proportions. Both teams play the game strictly according to tactics.
Players move into position to receive passes and gain possession. The ball, as in the real game, travels ahead of the player thus making a tackle is a matter of skill rather than of chance.

Kick Off 2 like real soccer, requires skills in ball control for passing, dribbling, shooting etc. Accuracy in shooting, the ability to swerve or bend the ball to score when taking free kicks needs a lot of practice. The practice option allows you to practice the ball skills and set pieces without being harassed by the opposition. Take your time and posites without being hara you to practice the ball ctice the skills to perfection. If two players are to team up, it is an ideal opportunity to practice ONE - TWO up and down the pitch.

Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of attributes and skills suitable for the skill level at which the game is being played. An international is superior to a 4th division player in all departments.

A host of playing options are provided. One of the most useful options is the provision to set the skill levels of both teams independently. A novice with an INTERNATIONAL squad can give a professional with a 4TH DIVISION squad a run for his money.

There is a league and cup tournament with sudden death penalty shoot outs in case of a draw. The teams in a league are on the whole evenly matched but with different styles of play and the player skills to match that style. There is an option to load your own team from Player Manager along with you own tactics to play another Player
Manager team in a single game or enter league and cup tournaments.

The of play and ecial events selection in the main menu allows data disks to be loaded.

Kick Off 2 also provides the facility to change strip colours and designs. On expanded machines, there are additional sound effects.

The action replay facility allows you to see the goals at normal pace or in slow motion and compile your own golden goals disks.

There are 24 referees and they have their own distinctive temperaments. You will soon know which referee turns a blind eye and which one has a pack of red cards to distribute. On the other hand, like human beings, they will have good days and bad days. You never know, you may catch Sean Willis on a good day but Gary Penn - unlikely!

## 2.0 MAIN MENU ##

The extra time is in two halves and the teams change ends at the half time. If the result is still a draw then a sudden death penalty shoot out decides the result.
This option is set to NO in the league matches and YES for the cup tournaments.

Choice of 5 skill levels : International, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Divisions. The attributes and skills of the players correspond to the division.

Each player on the pitch has a unique mixture of attributes and skills.

There attributes are
PACE - STAMINA - AGGRESSION - RESILIENCE

The skills are
PASSING - SHOOTING - TACKLING

The unique mixture determines the performance of the player. For instance, a player of great pace but with poor stamina will not perform well as the match nears the end and should be substituted if there is extra time in a cup match. Similarly a player with high
aggression will go for a ball and if he has good tackling skills will succeed in getting the possession but with low tackling skills is likely to foul the opposition and may even collect a red card if seen by the referee.

## 5.0 SELECTING SKILL LEVEL ##

Look at the scanner to see the positions of your players and select the suitable corner kick and press the F.B

#### 12.1.2 STRENGTH OF CORNER KICKS ####

The duration for which the F.B is kept pressed to select the type of corner kick determines the strength of the kick. A short tap will do a short kick i.e pass to a player near to the corner flag. A hard kick will take the ball to player player across or out of play.

### 12.2 PENALTIES ###

The angle and the height of the shot are controlled enabling the penalty taker to put the ball anywhere in the net.

The pointer on a bar moves rapidly from left to right indicating the horizontal direction of the ball if hit at that point. Press the F.B to start the run. The longer the F.B is kept pressed, the higher the ball will rise. It is therefore possible to hit the top corners of the net or keep the ball on the ground or overshoot the ball over the top of the goal. A short tap will keep the ball on the ground.

During the penalties, the keeper control is passed to the main player.
See KEEPER CONTROL instructions.

If two players are playing in team mode, the main player takes the free kick and the other controlled player stands on the side nearest to the goal.

Press the F.B to start the run. The duration for which the F.B is kept pressed determines the height of the ball. The longer the button is kept pressed, the higher the ball will rise. The strength of the kick is randomly computer controlled.

There are two distinct J/S controls: BEFORE touching the ball and AFTER touching the ball.
```

```
Only the player taking the free kick has swerve control of the ball.

With practice, he can dip the ball into opposition net or bend the ball round the opposition wall. The controls give infinite control on the kick and with practice, a match winner. If the ball is passed to another player, normal ball controls are resumed.

If the main player jumps over the ball, in the absence of a controlled player, one of the players next to the ball will take the kick.


#### 12.3.2 DEFENDING FREE KICK ####

A wall of players is formed 10 yards (approx.) from the ball in direct path of the ball.

If the number of goals remain equal, each side takes a penalty alternately. After both sides have taken their turn, if there is a goal difference, the team with the most goals is declared the winner. The shoot out continues until there is a goal difference.

## 16.0 GENERAL ##

The referees in the game have their own characteristics and competence level. Some are more prone than others in disciplinary action. They can give yellow and red cards.

The players with lower stamina are prone to get tired and lose pace as well as accuracy. The players are also inclined to time wasting if the winning margin is small.
