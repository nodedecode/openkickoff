# History #

Kick Off is a football simulation computer game series designed by Dino Dini.

In 1989, Anco published the first versions of Kick Off for the Amiga and Atari ST and it was immediately considered a pioneer of soccer computer games, thanks to the new original features never included in a football game before.

With Kick Off, contrary to all its predecessors, the ball did not stick to the player's feet, but instead was realistically kicked ahead from the players. This added an important degree of difficulty and skill requirement at the same time. This, along with all the new original features like action replays, players with different characteristics, different tactics, fouls, yellow cards, red cards, injuries, injury time and various referees with different moods, made Kick Off and especially its successor, Kick Off 2, one of the most successful football game series ever. Kick Off enthusiasts still play big World Cup competitions on original Amiga computers every year, arguing that no other football game gives so much exciting amount of control over the action.

Even though versions for other computers followed, the Atari ST and especially the Amiga versions were by far the most popular. Kick Off was first developed for the Atari ST and then ported to the Amiga.

Kick Off was developed by Dino Dini and Anco.

In 1990 Kick Off 2 was released by Anco. It was even more successful than its predecessor.
